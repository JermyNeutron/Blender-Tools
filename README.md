# Blender-Tools
This project contains several tools that I use to facilitate sharing my content from Blender.

## How-To
1. Copy and Paste
This is a basic python script that you can "copy and paste" into the Scripting tab of Blender. This script must be activated/ran everytime you open up Blender.


### Single-Cam__Render-Advance-0.1
This is a single camera function that is initiated through "saving" the program, or by pressing **CTRL+S**.
Regardless if the active camera is on a path or in a stationary position, the script just renders a single image of the current timeline frame with your project's render settings, and then advances to the next frame in the timeline. Because you advance to the next frame, the project will be left at an altered state: you will be prompted to save your project if you save and then quit.
